> **useEffect**
is a hook in React that allows you to run some side-effect code after rendering a component.

You need to use useEffect in the following situations:

- **Fetching data from an API**: *When you need to fetch data from an API or a database, you can use useEffect to make the request and update the component's state with the received data.*

- **Setting timers or intervals**: *If you need to set a timer or interval to perform some action at a later time, you can use useEffect to set it up and clean it up when the component is unmounted.*

- **Updating the DOM**: *When you need to update the DOM directly, such as setting a focus on an element or updating a DOM property, you can use useEffect to do so.*

- **Handling browser events**: *If you need to handle browser events such as scroll, resize, or mouse events, you can use useEffect to set up event listeners and clean them up when the component is unmounted.
Initializing third-party libraries: When you need to initialize a third-party library or plugin, such as a charting library or a map library, you can use useEffect to do so.*

- **Cleaning up resources**: *When you need to clean up resources such as event listeners, timers, or DOM elements, you can use useEffect with a cleanup function to do so.*

- **Running code only once**: *If you need to run some code only once, such as setting up a WebSocket connection or initializing a cache, you can use useEffect with an empty dependency array [] to run the code only once when the component mounts.*

- **useEffect returns undefined**


```
// Fetching data from an API
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setState(data));
}, []);

// Setting up an event listener
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  };
}, []);

// Initializing a third-party library
useEffect(() => {
  const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
    center: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
    zoom: 12,
  });
  return () => {
    map.destroy();
  };
}, []);

// Updating the DOM directly
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = 'New title';
}, []);

// Running code only once
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Component mounted!');
}, []);
