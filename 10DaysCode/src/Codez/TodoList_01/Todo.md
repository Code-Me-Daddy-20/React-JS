### 1. **To-Do List with Local Storage**

   **Key Concepts:** React Components, State Management, Event Handling, Local Storage.

   - **Description:** Create a simple to-do list application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Use React’s state to manage the list of tasks, and store the tasks in the browser’s local storage so that they persist even after a page refresh.

   - **Features:**
     - Add new tasks with a form.
     - Mark tasks as completed.
     - Edit and delete tasks.
     - Filter tasks by status (all, completed, incomplete).
     - Persist tasks using local storage.

   - **Challenges:** Focus on managing state effectively and using local storage to persist data.
