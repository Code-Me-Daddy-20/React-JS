React Fibre - The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline

              Fibre Functions - 
              :pause work and come back to it later.
              :assign priority to different types of work.
              :reuse previously completed work.
              :abort work if it's no longer needed.
