Vite - A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
       It has 2 parts -
       : A dev server
       : A build command that bundles your code (Rollup - bundler)

React Fibre - The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline 
              feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple 
              frames.

              Fibre Functions - 
              :pause work and come back to it later.
              :assign priority to different types of work.
              :reuse previously completed work.
              :abort work if it's no longer needed.


Reconciliation - The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
